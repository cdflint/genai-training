# Project Overview
This project leverages Azure OpenAI services to perform various tasks, including image extraction and document summarization. The workspace is structured to facilitate easy setup and execution of these tasks using Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

## Directory Structure
- `chains/`: Contains Python scripts for different processing chains.
  - `image_extract.py`: Script for extracting information from images.
  - `__pycache__/`: Compiled Python files.
- `images/`: Directory for storing images used in the project.
- `Examples/`: Contains example Jupyter notebooks and configuration files.
  - `Example 1.ipynb`: Example notebook demonstrating how to use the Azure OpenAI services.
  - `config.toml`: Configuration file for setting up Azure OpenAI services.
- `genai-auto-py3/`: Contains various DLL files and environment setup scripts.
- `models/`: Directory for storing model-related files.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `README.me`: This README file.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
- `setup.bat`: Batch script for setting up the Python environment.

## Setup Instructions
